# BlockOverlay
An 1.15 Fabric mod for Minecraft. Adds overlays to many blocks, showing their contents. Client-side.

## About
This mod adds simple block overlays to some general blocks. It is client-side only, so it can be used on nearly any server.

Please keep in mind that this mod fetches chest and furnace inventories by quickly opening them. This means it is easily detectable by other players and may trigger anti-cheat measures. DO NOT use this on servers where Anti-Cheat plugins are being used or mods like these are discouraged. You WILL get banned.

## Compiling
Build like any fabric mod.
